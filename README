mod_defensible is Apache 2.x module aiming to forbid IP listed
in DNSBL.

It will do DNS lookups to DNSBL you want and will return a 403 Forbidden
error code to the client.

You can use './configure --with-udns` to enable udns
(http://www.corpit.ru/mjt/udns.html) usage, which should be faster.

Configuration example:

DnsblUse On
DnsblServers bsb.spamlookup.net bl.blbl.org opm.blitzed.org sbl-xbl.spamhaus.org

If compiled with udns support, you can use a special nameserver with:
DnsblNameserver 127.0.0.1


  But why mod_defensible?
  Because:    ^   ^^ ^^
              d   ns bl
