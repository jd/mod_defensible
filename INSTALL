Installation Instructions
*************************

Just run ./configure. You can specify several useful options like:

  --with-apxs=path_to_apxs
    To specify the path to the apxs2 binary (/usr/bin/apxs2 is default).

  --with-udns
    To compile mod_defensible with udns support (better performance).
    This options needs libudns.

Then, type make and make install as root.
